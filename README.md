# BackendNodeJSRepo
For backend NodeJS learnings

### A Restaurant Project

* Consists of differents aspects of front side coding and server side coding.
  - In Front Side: We have made 
      - Some HTML file, styled them and added some responsiveness through basic JS.
      - All the files are arranged in such a way that they are easy to access for the backend coding.
      - Files are structured with required placeholders in order to help serverside access to those area easily.
      - However some of the changes are made during the serverside coding, but initial structuring helps the coder to manage and 
        interpret the requirements of the page and programs.
    
   -In Server-Side : or Backend coding, we make these files dynamic and interactive according to the user.
      - We go through the files, see the requirements, run the code on browser to get the initial conditions and functioning of the page and overall website.
      - we then go through the actual requirements of the page where the page or the website require backend support 
        i.e, to store data, to generate dynamic data and more.
      - For the initial requirements, we go through the requirements of Node Packages for the serverside code. like npm , Express, ejs engine and more.
        We have to install all.
      - Then we code for the access of the files in order to return them on the browser. To get access we use core nodejs methods like path and filesystem.
      - Access files through middleware and parse and render them in different get and post methods.
